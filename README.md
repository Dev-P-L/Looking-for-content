## This project is just in  preparation.
## It is about President Trump's tweets during previous election campaign.

### Question
Is it possible to separate tweets based on the device that sent them: Android or iPhone?

### It has been written that, on an average, tweets from the android device 
contain more hyperbolism. The purport of this project is to draw some avenues of research 
about hyperbolism measurement. 

But much more generally, hyperbolism will not be the only set of predictors 
when predicting the tweeting device. Other sets of predictors will be used,
such as e.g. tokens, sentiment analysis, time components, etc. 

Will be used as tools:

#### 1. Natural Language Processing and Text Mining
Cleaning tweets, removing URLs, punctuation, etc. Expanding hashtags (and mentions),
which would otherwise not match entries in existing sentiment analysis dictionaries.

#### 4. Machine learning

#### 5. Tweet Atribution per device
