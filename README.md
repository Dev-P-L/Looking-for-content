## This project is just in  preparation.
## It is about President Trump's tweets during previous election campaign.

### Question
Is it possible to separate tweets based on the device that sent them: Android or iPhone?

### Provisional content

#### 1. Natural Language Processing and Text Mining
Cleaning tweets, removing URLs, punctuation, etc. Expanding hashtags (and mentions),
which would otherwise not match entries in existing sentiment analysis dictionaries.

Tokenization, word frequencies and wordclouds per device, with or without proper nouns,
with or without hashtag expansion, etc. 

#### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis of other characteristics of tweets
Is it possible to separate tweets based on timing, number of words, number of retweets ?

#### 3. Sentiment Analysis
Matching tokens with existing sentiment analysis dictionaries.

#### 4. Machine learning

#### 5. Tweet Atribution per device
