# This README explains files and project.

## What are the files included in this repository?

* Tweet_Attribution_Stylometry.html is the output in HTML. 

For readers' convenience, Tweet_Attribution_Stylometry.html is an HTML document with interactive layout: the table of contents, the wordclouds, the graphs, and many tables are interactive; moreover, code can be visualized by pushing tag buttons on the right-hand-side of the HTML document.

Furthermore, for everyone’s convenience, I have tried using, when possible, colors that are clearly distinguishable to take into account alternative color perception, following pieces of advice given in [Cookbook R](http://www.cookbook-r.com/Graphs/Colors_(ggplot2)/). As far as code visualization is concerned — when pushing tag buttons on the right-hand-side of the HTML document —, I hope the theme espresso, which I have chosen, is satisfactory.

* Tweet_Attribution_Stylometry.rmd contains all code in R Markdown. 

You are most welcome to knit the file Tweet_Attribution_Stylometry.Rmd to produce the document Tweet_Attribution_Stylometry.html. If you wish to run or knit the file 
Tweet_Attribution_Stylometry.Rmd on your computer, I suggest placing the files Tweet_Attribution_Stylometry.Rmd and styles.css in the same folder.

* styles.css contains most layout specificities of the file Tweet_Attribution_Stylometry.html.

* train_tweets.csv contains all data from the training set.

* val_tweets.csv contains all data from the validation set.
