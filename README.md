## This project is just in  preparation.
## It is about President Trump's tweets during previous election campaign.

### Question
Is it possible to separate tweets based on the device that sent them: Android or iPhone?

### It has been written that, on an average, tweets from the android device 
contain more hyperbolism. The purport of this project is to draw some avenues of research 
about hyperbolism measurement. 

Then the hyperbolism criteria will be used to attribute tweets to one of the 
two devices. The attribution accuracy will be considered as a kind of measurement 
of hyperbolism. 

Will be used as tools:

#### 1. Natural Language Processing and Text Mining
Cleaning tweets, removing URLs, punctuation, etc. Expanding hashtags (and mentions),
which would otherwise not match entries in existing sentiment analysis dictionaries.

Tokenization, word frequencies and wordclouds per device, with or without proper nouns,
with or without hashtag expansion, etc. 

#### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis of other characteristics of tweets
Is it possible to separate tweets based on timing, number of words, number of retweets ?

#### 3. Sentiment Analysis
Matching tokens with existing sentiment analysis dictionaries.

#### 4. Machine learning

#### 5. Tweet Atribution per device
