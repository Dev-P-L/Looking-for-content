# Executive Summary

**An accuracy level of ... %** has been reached in attributing tweets. 

Tweets come from the account of Candidate Donald Trump during the 2016 presidential election campaign. Two devices have been used to issue tweets: an Android device and an iPhone. The challenge has been to predict the device on the validation set. 

Four types of predictors have been used:

- first, differences in **time patterns**, identified through **Exploratory Data Analysis**;
- second, differences in **token frequencies** (unigrams and bigrams), brought out through **Natural Language Processing** and **Text Mining**;
- third, differences in **sentiments** through **Sentiment Analysis**;
- fourth, differences in sentiment intensity and especially in **hyperbolism**, quantified through **Sentiment Analysis**.

The existence of differences in hyperbolism had been clearly exposed by ... For the record, ... quantified the differences in hyperbolism; our results and conclucions partially diverge from his. During the 2016 US presidential election then candidate Donald J. Trump used his tweeter account as a way to communicate with potential voters. On August 6, 2016 Todd Vaziri tweeted about Trump that "Every non-hyperbolic tweet is from iPhone (his staff). Every hyperbolic tweet is from Android (from him)." Data scientist David Robison conducted an analysis to determine if data supported this assertion. Here we go through David's analysis to learn some of the basics of text mining. 

Tweet attribution has been operated through Machine Learning with one algorithm: eXtreme Gradient Boosting. Several models have been tried and their performances have been evaluated thanks to bootstrapped resampling. The performance metric has been accuracy because the proportion of tweets sent by each device is close to 50 %, which means that a baseline model would have accuracy performance hardly larger than 50 %. 

On the validation set, the accuracy metric has reached ... %, ... percentage points being brought by Sentiment Analysis, ... percentage points by token frequencies and ... percentage points by time predictors.

Beyond prediction performance, previous Sentiment Analysis had mentioned a larger probability ... This project shows that ... Moreover, results are diametrically different when expanding hashtags since most hashtags are in tweets issued by ... 

A clear caveat should be issued: these results are based on Sentiment Analysis based on feelings associated with words. This does not at all take into account context, e.g. sarcasm, which is outside the scope of this project. This does not take on board negation either although negation can reverse sentiment polarity. To investigate that avenue, some Text Analytics has been conducted, showing that negation ...

A second caveat should be clearly expressed about the scope of this project. Data originate from the R package *dslabs*, and in particular from the dataset *trump_tweets*...; the dataset *trump_tweets* has itself been built up out of ...; this means that usage of this project is limited to ... 

Moreover, this project is merely technical; it expresses absolutely no political vision or standpoint; it is in no way person-related; and the author's methods, results and conclusions are only the ones explicitely expressed in this project itself, which only encompasses files lodged with the GitHub repository ...  

A colorblind friendly palette has been used (please see explanations in the next section).

# Welcoming Readers

Dear Readers,

For your convenience, the final document, i.e. ..., is an HTML document with all code available on demand, by pushing tag buttons on the right-hand-side of the HTML document. 

Furthermore, for everyone's convenience, I have tried using color-blind-friendly colors, following pieces of advice given at 
http://www.cookbook-r.com/Graphs/Colors_(ggplot2)/ . The idea is to have distinguishable colors in Protan, Deutan and Tritan vision. I hope this is useful.

The code highlighting style has been chosen in the YAML in this file: the value chosen is espresso, which, to my best knowledge, takes previous pieces of advice into account and, I hope, can be read with satisfaction by everyone. If code were not readily readable, you only have to change the value of *highlight* (please see available values at ... ) in the YALM and knit it again.

While knitting the file ..., I got a little bit into trouble with two tasks, and I was obviously not the only one according to complaints on the internet:

- downloading the lexicon ncr from package textdata 
- and with producing several wordcloud2 figures. 

Tips found on the internet are available here and here. These tips have worked perfectly well for me. Thanks to people who helped on the internet. Here links to the internet. Great pieces of advice.

## Data

Data are downloaded from the dataset *trump_tweets* from the R package *dslabs*.

```{r Downloading data}

data("trump_tweets")

tweets <- trump_tweets

# Let's normalize the dataset into utf8. Otherwise, 
# a problem was previously encountered with apostrophes: 
# the difference between curly and straight apostrophes 
# can impede stopword removal, especially so in case of 
# contractions; moreover, it can bias token frequency counts 
# by splitting appearances of the same token.

# Thanks to SarahWeaver 
# https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46814856/use-gsub-to-replace-curly-apostrophe-with-straight-apostrophe-in-r-list-of-chara

tweets$text <- 
  sapply(tweets$text, utf8_normalize, map_quote = TRUE)

rm(trump_tweets)
```

Let's have a look at the features from that dataset. Here are the eight features from the dataset. 

```{r Getting in touch with data, class.output = "bg-secondary"}

# Prints data frame description with bg-secondary layout.
str(tweets, vec.len = 1)
```

<br>

Documentation is available at ?trump_tweets in an R session.

Let's extract the relevant data, i.e. tweets issued by the Android device and by the iPhone. 

<br>

## Squeezing Data

We are interested in what happened during the campaign, so for the analysis here we will focus on what was tweeted between the day Trump announced his campaign and election day. So we define the following table.

```{r Squeezing dataset}

# The device names are kept only for both devices
# we are interested in. Moreover, they are simplified.

# The tweets are kept only if they were tweeted
# between the day Trump announced his campaign 
# and election day.

buffer <- tweets %>% 
  mutate(device = str_replace_all(
    str_replace_all(source, "Twitter for Android", "Android"), 
    "Twitter for iPhone", "iPhone")) %>%  
  filter(device %in% c("Android", "iPhone") &
         created_at >= ymd("2015-06-17") & 
         created_at < ymd("2016-11-08")) %>%  
  select(- source)

rm(tweets)
```

<br>

Here are the eight features again, this time from the new dataset, i.e. the squeezed dataset. 

```{r Getting in touch with extracted data, class.output = "bg-primary"}

# Prints data frame description with bg-primary layout.
str(buffer, vec.len = 1)
```

<br>

The table above tells us, among others, that the total number of rows is 3,950.

This is only one fifth of the original dataset but the number of observations suffices in principle to apply machine learning algorithms, even if the dataset is split into training set and validation set. 

Let's have a look at each variable. 

**id_str** is the tweet identifier. 

Is it an operational identifier: is it exclusively comprised of unique values?

```{r Checking up uniqueness of identifiers}

# Calculates number of observations and 
# number of unique identifiers. 

row_number <- nrow(buffer)
unique_identifiers <- length(unique(buffer$id_str))

# Table with both variables

tab <- data.frame(format(row_number, big.mark = " "),
                  format(unique_identifiers, big.mark = " ")) %>%
  `colnames<-`(c("Number of Observations", 
                 "Number of Unique Identifiers"))

# Prints table with "bg-info" layout. 

knitr::kable(tab, align = "c", 
             table.attr = "class=\'bg-info\'") %>% 
  kableExtra::kable_styling()

rm(tab)
```

The number of unique identifiers is exactly the number of tweets. Which means that the identifier has a different value for each tweet, which is a requirement for an identifier. Consequently, we'll keep this identifier.

**source** The source variable tells us the device that was used to compose and upload each tweet. We already know it is a character vector. Actually, it is the dependent variable or label: tweet attribution will be attribution of tweets either to the first device or to the second one. It might be interesting to know the breakdown of tweets by device.

```{r Breakdown of tweets by device}

# Table with breakdown of tweets by device

tab <- data.frame(buffer$device) %>%
  group_by(buffer$device) %>% 
  summarize(n = n(), 
            perc = n * 100 / length(buffer$device)) %>%
  mutate(n = format(n, big.mark = " ")) %>%
  mutate(perc = paste(round(perc, 1), "%", sep = " ")) %>%
  `colnames<-`(c("Device", 
                 "Number of Tweets by Device",
                 "Percentage of Tweets by Device"))

# Prints table with "bg-primary" layout. 

knitr::kable(tab, align = "c", 
             table.attr = "class=\'bg-primary\'") %>% 
  kableExtra::kable_styling()

rm(tab)
```

<br>

As shown in the table above, tweets by the iPhone are somewhat more numerous but the difference in percentage is limited.

A baseline model would predict device attributing to all observations the class with the most occurrences, i.e. iPhone. This would deliver very low prediction accuracy. 

Consequently, accuracy appears to be a rather satisfactory performance metric. It will be the performance metric in this project. 

**text**: the tweet itself; the tweets are represented by the text variable. Actually, the tweets will produce a lot of predictors — or independent variables — such as tokens, mentions, sentiment measurements or hyperbolism measurements. Thsi will be substantially developed in the following sections.

**created_at** containing the date and time at which the tweet was tweeted." 

It can be essential. It can deliver several predictors such as month, day, hour, etc. Again, this will be strongly developed in further sections. 

There are also two predictor candidates that relate to the tweeter's behaviour: *in_reply_to_user_id_str* and *is_retweet*. They might be good predictors. This will be investigated in the exploratory data analysis. 

*is_retweet*: "A logical telling us if it is a retweet or not." We see in the table above that the first value is *FALSE*; are there any "TRUE" values? It is a matter of variability: are there enough variations in this variable? 

```{r Checking for TRUE in is_retweet}

# Tab with number of FALSE/TRUE values in is_retweet

number_true <- sum(buffer$is_retweet)
number_false <- 
  length(buffer$is_retweet) - number_true

tab <- 
  data.frame(event = c("FALSE", "TRUE"), 
             number = c(number_false, number_true)) %>%
  mutate(number = format(number, big.mark = " ")) %>%
  `colnames<-`(c("Is the Tweet Actually a Retweet?",
                      "Number of Tweets"))

knitr::kable(tab, align = "c", 
             table.attr = "class=\'bg-primary\'") %>% 
  kableExtra::kable_styling()

rm(tab)
```

We can see that there is no TRUE value. This won't be investigated any further. This variable will be excluded since all values are *FALSE* and there is no variation.   

There can be some copy-paste inside of tweets, though. Could that be identified on the basis of quotes? This is a matter of analysis of the variable *text*, of the tweets themselves; it is a matter of content analysis; it will be done in the exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the training set on not on the part of the dataset that will become the validation set. 

*retweet_count*: "How many times tweet had been retweeted at time dataset was created." 

Would it make sense? Attribution would be made partially on the basis of other people's reactions! It is also dependent on the inventory date! It can prove an impactful predictor.

*favorite_count* is a problem similar to that of retweet_count.

As far as the last two variables are concerned, there could be prediction with them as predictors and one without them. This will be further investigated in the exploratory data analysis.

<br>

## Training Set

What about the training set?

In the previous section, we have noticed that the number of observations is almost 4,000 and the breakdown by device is almost even.

Let's take a prudent approach when splitting data in order to preemptively avoid suboptimal representation.

The number of rows suffices to reach statistical representativeness even in case of splitting into training set and validation set. It would be unadvisable to split more finely between training set, test set and validation set, though: this would further reduce the size of samples and, anyway, training set model optimization can be readily operated through e.g. bootstrapped resampling. 

The splitting proportion will be two thirds for the training set and one third for the validation set. What's the number of tweets by device in the training set?

```{r Splitting into training and validation sets and counting tweets by device}

# Creating the index of the validation set at random.

set.seed(1)
ind_val <- 
  createDataPartition(y = buffer$device, times = 1, 
                      p = 1/3, list = FALSE)

# Deducting the index of the training set.
ind_train <- as.integer(setdiff(1:nrow(buffer), ind_val))

# Creating the training set.
train_tweets <- buffer[ind_train, ]

# Creating the validation set. 
val_tweets <- buffer[ind_val, ]

rm(buffer, ind_val, ind_train)

# Table with tweet count by device

tab <- train_tweets %>%

# Way Forward

Now, let's get insights from the four groups of predictors:

- publication time: *created_at*,
- interaction: *in_reply_to_user_id_str*, *retweet_count* and *favorite_count*,
- token frequencies in *text*,
- sentiment nature and intensity in *text*.

About date and time, we will conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA),  exploring whether various predictors would seem relevant; morevoer, it will be an opportunity to check up whether each device's timing is so different from the other one that shift work is highly probable.

About interaction, we'll check up whether each candidate for predictor shows significant variation from one device to the other. 

Through Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Text Mining, token frequencies will be scrutinized. Do we habe significant differences between devices? Are differences stable or do they modify over time? Tokens can also be proper nouns, data (a device could possibly use more data), symbols (e.g. #1 can more frequent with one device, mentions and links. Mentions will also be split. MAGA will be explicited and split; we will check whether this impacts predictive power or not.

Sentiment analysis will be conducted. Words will be linked to sentiments, on the basis of preexisting sentiment files. They will also be ranked as positively polarized words or negatively polarized words and in intensity, once again on the basis of a preexisting file. Word intensity will be a criterion to measure up hyperbolism. Predictive power will be checked, as well for sentiments as for positiveness and negativeness and as for hyperbolism.

```{r Looking for biasing punctuation marks}

tweet_vector <- train_tweets %>%
  select(text) %>%
  as.data.frame() %>%
  `colnames<-`("tweets") 

tab <- tweet_vector %>% 
  mutate(index = str_detect(tweets, "great,")) %>%
  filter(index == TRUE) %>%
  select(- index) %>%
  as.data.frame() %>%
  `colnames<-`('Occurrences of Comma sticking to "Great"')

knitr::kable(tab, align = "c",  
             table.attr = "class=\'bg-primary\'") %>% 
  kableExtra::kable_styling()

```

<br>

These are just illustrative examples; if commas are not discarded, three appearances of great will not be added to the total occurrence of "great" because they will be treated as the token "great,".



ERADICATING PUNCTUATION FOR TOKENIZATION AND SENTIMENT ANALYSIS

First, some punctuation marks can stick to a word on their left and to another one on their right. Simply discarding these punctuation marks would lead to collapsing the two words into one token. This would result from applying the function removePunctuation() from the package tm. Consequently, punctuation marks will be replaced with an empty space character.

Second, if dots (aka periods or full stops) are replaced 
with empty space characters, then abreviations (and acronyms) 
would be scattered: "U.S.A." would become "U S A", i.e. 
in this case one abreviation would become three separate letters. 
Consequently, all dots will be replaced with empty space characters 
except when they just follow an uppercase letter. 

Third, the symbols # and @ will not be removed at this stage, 
in order to remain able to identify hashtags and mentions. Moreover, the token "#1" will be preserved: amalgamation with hashtags is to be avoided;
discarding it might remove a difference between devices. Consequently,
"#1" will be provisionally replaced with "NUMBERONE". 

Fourth, the symbol $ will also be preserved: there might be more financial amounts in tweets from one device.

By the way, apostrophes can be found essentially in two cases: in contractions and in genitives. At this stage, contractions will 
be preserved but genitives will be dismantled: apostrophes will be replaced with an empty space character. 

Digits are replaced with empty space characters instead of just being
removed to avoid collapsing the $ symbol with words in transforming 
"$13million" into "$million".

Other tokens will also be removed: "\n" and "&amp".

Replacing digits with empty space characters is problematic at 
this stage because some mentions can contain digits. 

"#1 " to avoid #100 ...

```{r Removing punctutation marks}
train_tweets <- train_tweets %>%
  mutate(text = str_replace_all(text, "\n" , " ")) %>%
  mutate(text = str_replace_all(text, "&amp", " ")) %>%
  mutate(text = str_replace_all(text, '\"' , " ")) %>%  
  mutate(text = str_replace_all(text, "http.*" , 
                                " link_placeholder ")) %>%
  mutate(text = str_replace_all(text, "[/(),:;!?–•…-]" , " ")) %>%
  mutate(text = str_replace_all(text, "[?@]", " @")) %>%
  mutate(text = str_replace_all(text, "[?#]", " #")) %>%
  mutate(text = str_replace_all(text, "[$]", " $ ")) %>%
  mutate(text = str_squish(text)) %>%
  as.data.frame()
```

Let's replace dots with empty space characters if dots are trailing dots following a lowercase letter.

```{r Removing dots after lowercase letter}
text <- train_tweets$text
seq_text <- seq_along(text)
for (i in seq_text) {
  g <-                                 # g = positions of lowercase + dot
    unlist(gregexpr(pattern = "[a-z]\\.", text[i]))
  seq_g <- seq_along(g)                # Sequence 
  for (j in seq_g) {                   # loop on all positions of lower...
    pos <- g[j] + 1                    # Calculating position of dot.
    substr(text[i], pos, pos) <- " "   # Replacing dot with empty space.
    }
}

train_tweets$text <- text
```

Now we can remove all remaining dots without replacing them with 
empty space characters, which would ruin our preserving 
abreviations. 

```{r Removing all remaining dots}
train_tweets <- train_tweets %>%
  mutate(text = str_replace_all(text, "[\\.]", ""))
```

Let's replace apostrophes from genitives with empty space
characters. 

There are many genitives, few contractions ending in "s".

```{r Replacing apostophes from genitives with empty space characters}
# To preserve contractions ending in 's, they will be provisionally
# replaced with placeholders.

contractions <- c("here's", "he's", "how's", "it's", "let's", "she's", "that's", "there's", "what's", "when's", "where's", "who's", "why's")
place_holders <- paste0("contraction", seq_along(contractions))

for (i in seq_along(contractions)) {
  train_tweets$text <- str_replace_all(train_tweets$text, 
                         contractions[i], place_holders[i])
}

# Now, we can securely discard apostrophes from "'s " (mostly in genitives).
train_tweets$text <- str_replace_all(train_tweets$text, 
                         "'s ", " s ")
  
# We also discard trailing apostrophes (at the end of words), e.g. in 
# genitives without s or as trailing single quotation marks.
train_tweets$text <- str_replace_all(train_tweets$text, 
                         "' ", " ") 

# We also discard leading apostrophes, e.g. as leading single quotation marks or in abbreviated two-digit format for years.
train_tweets$text <- str_replace_all(train_tweets$text, 
                         " '", " ")

# Let's notice that contractions have been preserved:
# on the first hand, 13 contractions ending in "'s" 
# have been replaced with placeholders not containing apostrophes
# and other contractions not ending in "'s" have not been
# impacted. 

# Now, let's reconvert placeholders to the original
# contractions, just for clarity. 
for (i in seq_along(contractions)) {
  train_tweets$text <- str_replace_all(train_tweets$text, 
                         place_holders[i], contractions[i])
} 
```

Now, we have removed most punctuation marks; most tokens have
been "liberated" from trailing punctuation marks; the tokens 
"#1 " can now be converted into "NUMBERONE" to preserve them
and isolate them from real Twitter hasthtags. Afterwards, 
digits can be removed from tweets. 

```{r Insulating tokens #1 and discarding digits}
train_tweets$text <- str_replace_all(train_tweets$text, 
                       "#1 ", " NUMBERONE ")
train_tweets$text = str_replace_all(train_tweets$text, 
                       "[0-9]", "")
```

Let's notice that digits are simplys removed and are
not substituted for empty space characters to not dismantle
hashtags and mentions containing digits. 

We do not lowercase at this stage because we want to keep uppercase
letters to expand hashstags and mentions.

<br>

Contrary to the picture of hashtag presence in tweets, the number of mentions in Android tweets and in iPhone tweets is not so different. Nevertheless, the number of mentions per tweet will be taken on board without first checking its predictive power in tweet attribution.


```{r Adding the number of mentions per tweet as a predictor}

```

        axis.text.y = element_text(size = 12),
        legend.text = element_text(size = 12),
        # remove the vertical grid lines
        panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.minor.x = element_blank()) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = duo_Palette) +
  theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = sky_blue)) 
graph
```

<br>

Just as in the case of hashtags, the number of links appears as a strong predictor in tweet attribution: the number of iPhone tweets with a link clearly outnumbers the number of Android tweets with a link. It will surely be used in tweet attribution.

```{r Adding predictor number of hashtags per tweet}
train_tweets <- train_tweets %>%
  mutate(link_count = link_count)
```

Here, no distinction is made on the basis of the number of links per tweet because the breakdown is bipolar: it is either zero or one link per tweet. 

In a snapshot, in number of hashtags and number of links, the iPhone tweets outnumber the Android tweets, which contain a little bit more mentions. The number of hastags and the number of links appear as two solid predictors in tweet attribution and the number of mentions is a candidate predictor, whose predictive power has still to be checked up. 

################################################

Now let's turn to hashtag and mention expansion. 

The idea is very simple: most hastags and mentions are comprised of several common nouns and/or proper nouns. From a semantic point of view, these separate nouns make sense to human beings. But as long as they are encapsulated, they cannot be used in sentiment analysis. Moreover, they cannot be amalgamated with the same nouns outside of hashtags or mentions and impact word frequencies. Consequently, these nouns are going to be extracted so that they can enter sentiment analysis and word frequencies. 

The method will also be very simple. Very often nouns encapsulated in hashtags and mentions are capitalized. Consequently hashtags and mentions will be expanded using uppercase letters: hashtags and mentions will be split between a lowercase letter followed by a uppercase letter. E.g. "@MakeAmericaGreatAgain" will become "Make America Great Again".

But there is no splitting on an uppercase letter following another uppercase letter.  In the case of "MAGA", which is an acronym referring to the same expression, it might make sense to expand "MAGA" into "Make America Great Again", which is symbolically the equivalent but cannot be dealt with in the same way if not expanded. Consequently, let's create a second vector called *hashtags_fully_expanded* with "MAGA" being expanded. 

Let's get started with hashtags. 

```{r Expanding hashtags}
hashtags <-                                     # Hashtags by tweet
  str_extract_all(train_tweets$text, "#\\S+")

# Unlisting list of hashtags into character vector of hastags.
for (i in seq_along(hashtags)) {
  hashtags[i] <- paste(unlist(hashtags[i]), collapse = " ")    
}
hashtags <- unlist(hashtags)

# Let's expand hashtags tweet by tweet
hashtags_expanded <- seq_along(hashtags)        # Storage vector for 
                                                # expanded hashtags
for (i in seq_along(hashtags)) {
  w <- hashtags[i]
  w <- str_replace_all(w, "#", "")              # Removing # symbol
  
  # Splitting on uppercase letter following lowercase letter
  # https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43706474/splitting-string-betw     een-capital-and-lowercase-character-in-r
  
  w <- strsplit(w, "(?<=[a-z])(?=[A-Z])", perl = TRUE)
  w <- paste(unlist(w), collapse = " ")         # Unlisting again
  ifelse(w == character(0), " ", w)
  hashtags_expanded[i] <- w
  }

# Let's expand "MAGA" as "Make America Great Again".
hashtags_fully_expanded <- hashtags_expanded
hashtags_fully_expanded <- 
  str_replace_all(hashtags_fully_expanded, 
                  "MAGA", "Make America Great Again")

# Let's add hashtages, expanded hashtags and fully expanded hashtags to data frame train_tweets. 
train_tweets$hashtags <- hashtags
train_tweets$hashtags_expanded <- hashtags_expanded
train_tweets$hashtags_fully_expanded <- hashtags_fully_expanded

# Let's retrieve hashtags from the feature text.
train_tweets$text <- str_remove_all(train_tweets$text, "#\\S+")

# Let's also isolate "link_placeholder" into a separate feature.
# First retrieving "link_placeholder" into a list.
l <- str_extract_all(train_tweets$text, "link_placeholder")

# Then unlisting list of "link_placeholder" into character vector.
for (i in seq_along(l)) {
  l[i] <- paste(unlist(l[i]), collapse = " ")    
  ifelse(l[i] == character(0), " ", l[i]) 
}
l <- unlist(l)

# Then inserting the vector into the data frame.
train_tweets$link_placeholder <- l

# Finally, removing "link_placeholder" from the feature text.
train_tweets$text <- 
  str_remove_all(train_tweets$text, "link_placeholder")
```

<br>

Four new features have been added in the data frame *train_tweets*: 
- hastags,
- expanded hastags,  
- fully expanded hashtags
- and link_placeholder.

DEALING WITH MENTIONS

Are mentions worth expanding? 

Mentions are mainly comprised of proper nouns. Proper nouns do not figure in sentiment analysis lexicons and consequently cannot help in sentiment analysis. But proper nouns can impact token frequency analysis. Consequently, mentions will also be expanded. 

The expansion process used for hashtags will be applied again. But it will be preceded by an additional module. Among mentions in training_tweets$text, there are often two (or sometimes three) variants of the same mention: one with lowercase only and one with a mixture of lowercase letters and uppercase letters, the latter ones being used at the beginning of (some) words. Opting for the variants with a mix of letters would boost our splitting process, which is triggered by uppercase letters following lowercase letters. Consequently, let's opt for the variants with a mix of letters. 

```{r Opting for mention variants with uppercase letters}
# Extracting all mentions into a list. 
mentions_per_tweet <- str_extract_all(train_tweets$text, "@\\S+")

# Unlisting list of mentions into character vector of mentions.
for (i in seq_along(mentions_per_tweet)) {
  mentions_per_tweet[i] <- 
    paste(unlist(mentions_per_tweet[i]), collapse = " ")    
}
mentions_per_tweet <- unlist(mentions_per_tweet)

# Let's create a character vector with all mention variants.
mentions <- unique(paste(unlist(mentions_per_tweet), sep = " "))

# Let's remove the underscore symbol. 
surrogate <- gsub("_", "", mentions)

# Hashstags (partially or totally) uppercased will be substituted
# for hashtags all lowercased.

ind_mix <-                                   # Mix of upper and
  grep("[A-Z]", surrogate[ind], perl=TRUE)   # possible lower

ind_lower <-                                 # Only lowercase 
  setdiff(seq_along(surrogate), ind_mix)   

# Preference to hashtags with mix above
# hashtags all in lowercase letters
hashtags_lower <- surrogate[ind_lower]
hashtags_mix <-                            # Preference to more upper
  sort(surrogate[ind_mix], decreasing = TRUE) 

for (i in seq_along(ind_lower)) {
  
  for (j in seq_along(ind_mix)) {
    
    if(hashtags_lower[i] == tolower(hashtags_mix[j]))
    {hashtags_lower[i] <- hashtags_mix[j]
    }
    
  }
}

# Reinstating newly partially uppercased hashtags.
surrogate[ind_lower] <- hashtags_lower

# Preference to hashtags with mix above
# hashtags all in uppercase letters
hashtags_upper <- surrogate[ind_upper]

for (i in seq_along(ind_upper)) {
  
  for (j in seq_along(ind_mix)) {
    
    if(hashtags_upper[i] == toupper(hashtags_mix[j]))
    {hashtags_upper[i] <- hashtags_mix[j]
    }
    
  }
}

# Reinstating newly partially lowercased hashtags.
surrogate[ind_upper] <- hashtags_upper

# Reinstating uppercase letter in second position
substr(surrogate, 2, 2) <- substr(toupper(surrogate), 2, 2)

# Checking
df <- data.frame(unique, surrogate)
df

g <- grep("#GOPdebate ", train_tweets$text)
length(g)
train_tweets$text[g]
```

In our search for candidate predictors, let's now turn to token frequency, looking for tokens with highly differentiated frequency between Android and iPhone. What matters is big difference in absolute frequencies and not ratios [if required, more explanation].

Extracting the 12 hour interval as am/pm values has been done using a piece of advice of Jaap's on Stack Overflow. This is interesting. But this solution has proven unstable in my workenvironnement and I have opted out of this solution and have opted into something simpler (see above).

Since you are using fixed strings, not regular expressions, you need to tell the regex engine to use the patterns as plain, literal text. With fixed().

The \\1 is syntax for the last capture in a regular expression using the () 
It says whatever was matched, replace it with that. 
I put only the "." and "-" in the group (), so \\1 will replace .- 
(by the same vale), so it keeps them here. – agstudy Feb 3 '14 at 20:02

Extracting hashtags
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13762868/how-do-i-extract-hashtags-from-tweets-in-r
There are two levels of parsing going on here. 
Before the low level regexp function within str_extract 
gets the pattern you want to search for (i.e. "#\S+") 
it is first parsed by R. R does not recognize \S 
as a valid escape character and throws an error. 
By escaping the slash with \\ you tell R to pass the \ and S 
as two normal characters to the regexp function, 
instead of interpreting it as one escape character.
v <- str_extract_all(train_tweets$text, "#\\S+")

SPLITTING BETWEEN LOWER CASE AND UPPER CASE

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43706474/splitting-string-between-capital-and-lowercase-character-in-r
We can use regex lookaround to match lower case letters 
(positive lookbehind - (?<=[a-z])) followed by upper case letters 
(positive lookahead -(?=[A-Z]))
